## 1.1.0 (2020-09-23)

v1 release! ðŸŽ‰

- [fix] Disable the 'bypass' rule by default.
- [fix] Force one call to `axe.run` to finish before the next can start, preventing [dequelabs/axe-core#1041](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/issues/1041) when things go wrong in a test.

- Change the Mocha reporter to "spec".
- Add integration tests.

## 0.2.1 (2020-09-16)

- [breaking] Remove `--debug` option
- [new] Add `--headless` option (defaults to true)
- [new] Add `--browser` option (defaults to chromium. Accepts chromium, firefox, or webkit)
